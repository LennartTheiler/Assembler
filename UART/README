UART Communication with Interrupt Handling for 8-Bit Microcontroller
This project implements a simple UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) communication system using an 8-bit microcontroller and assembly language. It transmits a sequence of characters over a serial connection at a baud rate of 9600 and echoes received data to an output port. The system utilizes interrupts for efficient data handling.

Key Features:

-UART communication at 9600 baud
-Interrupt-driven transmission and reception
-Polling-based flag mechanism for data flow control
-Low-level microcontroller programming in assembly

Ideal for learning embedded serial communication, interrupt-based data handling, and microcontroller programming.
